Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12- and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock. In doing so i 
created two clocks basiclly.

What did you do particularly well?
I did great on organzing my work together creating a easy understanding in my code work.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
No where in particular i needed to enhance my code. Luckly i got a pretty good understanding when doing and conducting my work. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
When applying the numbers to understand the diffience in 12 hour vs 24 hour clock.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The things that are similair to other codes will help me in all fields. Which can help me master all codes you can write like Python, Java, etc.
